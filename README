INSTALLING
  Since this program is relying on some files of Vision Lab Feature Library
(VLFeat), please copy the vlg directory to the same place with vlfeat:
for example,
               /lib/
               /lib/vlfeat/
               /lib/vlg/


COMPILING
  VLG requires VLFeat installed and compiled ahead. The compiling process is
as same as compiling VLFeat. Please compile VLFeat first, and do the same thing
for VLG.


RUNNING
  As you set the Matlab path for VLFeat, do the similar thing for VLG:

  >> cd vlg/toolbox;
  >> vlg_setup;

  Then you can run test scripts for your first step:

  >> test_mview

  or

  >> test_incremental

  or

  >> demo_vlmvg


DOCUMENTATION
  Matlab functions have their help documentations within themselves. If you
want to read the Matlab documentation together, check the html documents:

  vlg/doc/index.html
